# react-ai-image

Simple AI image generation app with React and Express. Create a ```.env``` file in the ```backend``` folder and add variables ```PORT='port_here'``` and ```OPENAI_API_KEY='key_here'``` to run. API key can be obtained from [OpenAI](beta.openai.com). ```frontend``` folder also requires an ```.env``` file with the variable ```PORT='backend_port_here'```.
